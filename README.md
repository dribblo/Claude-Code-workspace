# Claude Code Workspace

> A simple way to make Claude Code remember who you are.

I got tired of re-explaining myself every time I opened Claude Code. So I built a workspace structure that makes it context-aware from the first message. Clone it, run the wizard, and every future session starts already knowing you.

**Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — available in the terminal or inside the Claude desktop app.

## How it works

Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` at the start of every session. This repo gives you a ready-made structure for that file — and the rest of your workspace — so Claude always starts informed, focused, and in the right mode.

```
Your repo/
  CLAUDE.md          ← auto-loaded by Claude Code. This is the plugin.
  .claude/
    modes/
      work.md        ← context for work tasks
      my-project.md  ← context for a specific project
      learning.md    ← context for study sessions
    templates/       ← output formats you use repeatedly
    skills/          ← reusable workflows
    config.json      ← your name, default mode, preferences
```

Every session starts like this:

```
Claude: Hey Daniel. What's this about?
  1. work  (default)
  2. my-project
  3. learning

You: 1

Claude: Work mode. What's the task?
```

That's it. No re-explaining. No setup. Just work. You can switch modes mid-session anytime.

## Quickstart

Open Claude Code and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dribblo/Claude-Code-Workspace.git
cd Claude-Code-Workspace
```

The wizard starts automatically. It will interview you about your work, build your personalised mode files, and set up your entire workspace in a single conversation.

## Modes

A mode is a Markdown file that tells Claude:

- **Who you are** in this context
- **What this mode is for**
- **How you want Claude to behave**
- **Background knowledge** it should always have
- **A kick-off question** to open every session

| Mode | Use case |
|---|---|
| `work.md` | Emails, documents, meetings, professional communication |
| `personal.md` | Life admin, decisions, planning, personal projects |
| `learning.md` | Understanding topics deeply, studying, research |
| `creative.md` | Writing, brainstorming, ideation, creative projects |
| `project-template.md` | Blank template for any specific project |

---

## Commands

Say any of these during a session:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `switch mode` | Change to a different mode mid-session |
| `status` | See your current mode, session history, and workspace health |
| `reset` | Re-run the wizard from scratch (backs up your files first) |
| `update` | Pull the latest improvements from the template repo |
| `export` | Create a shareable, anonymised version of your setup |

---

## Features

- **Auto-save** — changes to your workspace are committed automatically
- **Session memory** — Claude writes a summary at the end of every session
- **Smart enrichment** — Claude suggests adding new terms, people, and decisions it notices during your session
- **Output templates** — standardised formats for the documents you write most
- **Workflow skills** — reusable workflows for recurring tasks

## Why I built this

Claude Code is powerful out of the box — but blank. Every session starts the same way: you explain who you are, what you're working on, how you like to communicate. Again. And again.

This is my solution — a file structure that Claude Code reads automatically. No plugin, no extension, no installs. It works today with the Claude Code you already have. I'm sharing it because it's been useful to me and might be useful to you.
